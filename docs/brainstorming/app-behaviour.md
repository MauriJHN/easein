# App Behaviour

Notes on what I expect the app to provide to the user:

- The app should have the timer as the landing page with the pomodoro timer configured.
- The configuration button should be kinda muted but visible, it should feel like the button is hidden away from the user.
- Session data should be displayed for the day.
- The session data container should show statistics page when clicked.
- Configuration should include theme color option.
- Configuration should also include 2 controls for the sound when work is done and when rest is done.
- There should also be an option for a long rest to be included.
