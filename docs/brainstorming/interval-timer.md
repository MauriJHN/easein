# Interval Timer Design

## Notes on View

- The interval timer should be a simple MM:SS styled display
- There should be an input for the duration of each interval

## Notes on Component

- There should be a state to track if the timer is running
- A reset function
- A start function
- A pause function
- An option to have dynamic intervals running in a loop?
