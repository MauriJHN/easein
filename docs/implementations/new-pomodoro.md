# Pomodoro Timer App

## Goal

Get a minimal, but functional app going in the new app page.

## Steps

1. Create a new component that tracks the work and rest durations
2. Create a new component to display the statistical data onto the screen
3. Create new configuration component to set values for the pomodoro timer
4. Create basic app with all components working
5. Create alpha tag for working application
6. Modify app to look good in the UI
7. Create new design for application on Figma
8. Update version and create new beta tag with working application
9. Finish course on SvelteKit and brainstorm performance or feature enhancements for the application

## Notes on Implementation

- Always push changes to the remote branch
- Always create at least basic unittesting for every new component and new features

## Tracking Work and Rest Durations

- Would it make sense to use context functionality to store the values?
- Could I include the tracking logic inside the component responsible of tracking statistics, or would the data be transferred among components to display statistical data
