# `easein`

Just taking notes before defining requirements for application.

## Development

- I want to follow KISS as much as possible, keeping modularity but reducing the number of files as much as possible
  - Documenting implementations should be a 3 step process:
    1. Goals: description of what is being implemented and what the outcome should look like
    2. Plan and diagrams: basic steps of implementation and any diagrams with a description of what they are illustrating
    3. Issues: any notes on issues that arise during implementation (literally any type of notes)
- Documentation: I want everything during implementation documented, including any twists or issues that arise
- **I want to setup a development and staging environment early on, this could be placed as the first priority**
- Nothing should be generated by AI, I want to write the code myself, only using autocompletion for menial tasks

## Production

- I want to include ads right away, but I want to research what are some strategies to make ads less of a distraction of the application, maybe timing when the ads appear on screen (configuration screen or whatnot)
- I want a very cool URL (inexpensive)
