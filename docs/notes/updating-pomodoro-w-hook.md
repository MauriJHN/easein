# Updating Pomodoro Timer Component

Just notes on how the upgrade of the Pomodor timer component will be updated to include the logic for the `useTimer.svelte.ts` hook.

## Notes

- I can try adding a callback when the timer completes and then executing the changes within that callback from inside the pomodoro component
